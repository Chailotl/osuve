Welcome to osuve's documentation!
=================================

OSUVE is my take on a voxel engine, made open-source to the world to put so that others may benefit from the knowledge that is accumulated here, and perhaps contribute some of their own. I will be continually working on this until it becomes a working product. (After all, I have plans to make a game with it!)
